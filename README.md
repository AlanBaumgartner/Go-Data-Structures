## Abstract Data Types
### Singly Linked List
#### What is a Singly Linked List?
A singly linked list is a linear data type similar to an array with a different philosophy on length mutability. An array normally has a static size whereas a linked list can be any size, all it has to do is store a reference to the next node in the current last node. A singly linked list only stores a reference to the first node and the next node.

### Doubly Linked List
#### What is a Doubly Linked List?
A doubly linked list is almost identical to a singly linked list with the addition of a tail node and a previous node reference. This takes up more memory per node but allows you to easily backtrack when iterating through the nodes.
